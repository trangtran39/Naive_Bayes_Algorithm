		VALIDATION SET
Choice of language: Python3

Formula used to calculate Probability: 
	Laplace P(Ai|C)=(Nic +1)/(Nc + c)

We have: P(C|X)=p(X|C)*P(C)/P(X) where C is class, X is test record
P(X1,X2,X3...|C)=P(X1|C)*P(X2|C)*P(X3|C)*...
Since all P(Cn|X) share same denominator which is P(X) 
==> We just need to calculate P(X|C)*P(C), then pick out the class that has highest probability
Once we generated array of predict values for validation dataset, we could compare those value to the actual value
By doing so, we could see the accuracy of our classification

Overall Performance:
	Number of correct classification is 23
	Number of incorrect classification is 7
	Accuracy is 0.766667

Accuracy for class 2 is 0.866667

Accuracy for class 3 is 0.615385

Accuracy for class 4 is 1.000000
